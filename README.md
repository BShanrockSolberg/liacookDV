To follow the process used, read these documents
* **lc_clean.Md**  - Shows data cleansing process.  
* **lc_stats.Md**  - Shows statistical analysis used and results
* **lc_vis.MD**    - Shows preliminary visualization efforts

Lia Cook used these files as a basis for which graphs and charts she
would incorporate back into her art.  In order to reproduce the work
the following must be done:

* Download this entire github repository, with subfolders into a R working folder  
* install package/klibrary "knitr" and run "knit2html lc_clean.Rmd"
* At this point all code in lc_stats.Rmd and lc_viz.Rmd will work

The graph utilities in lc_compare.R can be used to control aspect ratio, whether or not a stylized graphic face is added and the size or thickness of the graphic elements.
Specific graphs used by Lia Cook in planning her data visualization works were generated using the lc_compare.R utilities but exact parameters and output will not be provided here, as they are her intellectual property.
